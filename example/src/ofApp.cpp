    //   loosely interpreted as how uncertain the data is / how difficult it is
    //   to be modeled by a probability distribution. generally speaking, larger
    //   datasets need a higher perplexity, but if your points end up looking
    //   like a poorly-arranged uniformly-distributed ball, your perplexity is
    //   too high. this value is usually set between 5 and 50 with 30 being
    //   a good default. t-SNE is fairly insensitive to this parameter so
    //   in most cases the default should work fine.
    // theta / angle = this parameter controls the accuracy/speed tradeoff
    //   of the Barnes-Hut simulation used to solve the t-SNE embedding. low
    //   theta is more accurate but slower, and high theta is faster but
    //   maybe less optimal solution. it should be between 0 and 1. in practice

    //   noticeable accuracy.
